    <h1><strong>3- How to add a Z-Wave smart door lock to your SmartThings app</strong></h1>
  </center>
  <h2>This article will guide you on installing a new Z-Wave Yale lock step by step and connecting it to your
    SmartThings hub and app.</h2>
  <h4>Before you start, make sure that the smart lock you are about to install is on the <a href="../faq_content/lock_support_faq.html" target="_blank" >list of currently
      supported locks.</a> </h4>
  <h3>Let's get started!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Install the lock on the door</strong> (latch & strike plate, keypad, interior mounting plate, attach the
      cable assembly,
      interior Escutcheon) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li>When the lock is on the door, insert the Z-Wave Plus module (green plastic module) above the battery
      compartment. See the green Z-Wave module in the photo above. Please take note that if you cannot find the module,
      it sometimes gets stuck in the dark plastic packaging as it is very light.</li>
    <li>Install the batteries & cover using a small Philips screwdriver.
      <h4>Example: Yale model YRD216-ZW<br>

    </li>
    </h4>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Set the 4-6 digits Master pin code.</strong> Of note, this is the first step that is required to
      activate the lock. If
      not done first, the lock cannot be configured or installed.</li>
    <li><strong>Now you can connect it to the SmartThings app.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>On the SmartThings app home page, start adding the device. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Click on the <strong>+ icon</strong> on the top right.</li>
    <li>The <strong>"Add"</strong> page opens - click <strong>"Add device"</strong><br>

    </li>
    <li>On the <strong>"Add device page," scroll down to the bottom of the page to the search "by device type" or "By
        brand" tabs.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Search for the smart lock or any other device by Brand.</strong><br>

      <img src="../images/add_z_wave_smart_door_images/add_device_lock_2.png" height="438" width="256">
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>"View by model name".</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Click on the specific Z-Wave lock model on the list.</strong><br>

      <img src="../images/add_z_wave_smart_door_images/z_wave_model_2.png" height="438" width="256">
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ok, get started with your Yale Z-Wave Lock!</strong></li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Start".</strong><br>
      <img src="../images/add_z_wave_smart_door_images/started.png" height="438" width="256">
    </li>
    <li><strong>Select the closest hub that you wish to connect with.</strong> This is where having named any Hub with a
      descriptive name of its location will help you find it easily.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Next"</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>SmartThings now prepares to connect with the lock - Be patient!</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Then, follow carefully the 5 steps called out in the app.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <img src="../images/add_z_wave_smart_door_images/pick_hub_2.png" height="438" width="256">
    </li>
    <li><strong>Success!</strong> The lock has been added to SmartThings app with a default name but there is one more
      important task to do.
      <h4>
        Critical Step!
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure to rename the smart lock starting with the word "Lock" followed by the name of its "Location."
          <strong> Ex.
            "Lock-Room 101".</strong> This specific lock name will make it easier later to add this lock to a specific
          zone in
          Devicethread app.
        </li>
        <li><strong> If you skip this step, it will be very difficult setting up this lock in Devicethread.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </li>
    <li>SmartThings gives the installed smart lock a generic default name.</li>
    <li>Rename it right away so you do not forget!
      <br>

    </li>
    <li><strong>Bravo! The SmartThings shows all the devices currently associated with your property and Samsung
        account, which includes the one you just installed.</strong> You can make out where the devices are with the
      descriptive names you assigned to each device.
