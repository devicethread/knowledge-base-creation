    <h2>This article covers all the tasks you should complete before connecting your Cloudbeds account with the
        Devicethread app.</h2>
    <div class="pls-make">
        <p><strong>Please make sure you have completed the following steps before connecting Cloudbeds and
                Devicethread.</strong> </p>
        <p>See how to perform all four key steps in the following article <a href="./before_connecting_cb_dt.html">
                here.</a></p>
        <p><strong>In summary:</strong> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The primary user of your organization has downloaded the app from Devicethread's listing in the
                    Cloudbed
                    marketplace.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You have set up one property: Name, Address, Users, etc. See <a href="">how to set up
                        Devicethread</a>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You have set up one or more SmartThings hubs for this property on your SmartThings app using your
                    SmartThings account (our demo has two accounts and multiple hubs). See how to set up SmartThings app
                    and
                    hub(s).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You have completed setting up all of the smart locks on the property and connected them to the
                    SmartThings
                    hub. See how to set up smart locks.</p>

            <p><strong> The last step of the setup is to define which specific "Zoned and locks" each guest staying
                    in a
                    specific room/accommodation will have access to on the property.</strong> This is done in
                Devicethread by
                assigning all the appropriate <strong> "Zones"</strong> to each specific <strong>
                    "Collection"</strong>.
                Remember, you have already set up
                the Zones for the property before connecting the integration. if you have not done this yet, you can
                do
                it before continuing.
            </p>

            <p> <strong> For example,</strong> a guest staying in Room 101 should be able to open the Room 101 door
                lock, the Lobby front
                door lock, the backdoor lock, and the fitness room. In this example, a guest staying in Room 101
                would
                receive a 4 or 6-digit lock code that will work in any of those 4 door locks and have access to
                these
                rooms during his stay at the property. After they check out, their codes will be expired and no
                longer
                work. </p>
        </div>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The following task will have to be repeated for each <strong>"Collection"</strong>. Do not worry; this
                needs to be done
                only
                once when the integration is first connected. Also, you will be able to change these settings for each
                <strong>"Collection"</strong> at any time in the future:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Select a specific <strong>"Collection"</strong> from the list.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Click <strong>"Add Zones".</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Now you can see the list of "Zones".</strong> Remember, these are all of the "Zones" you
                        have created
                        previously. Each zone has one or more door locks (devices) that you associated with it.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <li>
            <p>Select all the property <strong>"Zones"</strong> by checking the boxes of the <strong>"Zones"</strong> a
                guest staying in that Room/Accommodation will have access to during their stay. <strong>Check all the
                    appropriate boxes.</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Click <strong>"Assign Selected Items"</strong>.

            </p>

            <p>After completing this, <strong>Voila! You are done with the initial setup and can now go back to the
